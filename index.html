					<h5 class="padding-32 text-white h5-btc-text">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was meant for a new form of currency to be
					free from the current market and a full-on global currency. In it's infancy,
					people have judged it and said that it is not a currency and that since it is
					digital, that it can be easily manupulated which in some cases could be true.
					It however is inevitable that it will become a form currency that will be 
					widely accepted globally and there is no government that can stop it.</h5>

				mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.</h5>

					$.0001 (2009) to its All-Time Peak of ~$20,000 (End of 2017). This then begs the question, where are we today? Today's price is

					decide to do so, please invest at your own risk!</h5>

					<h5 class="four-padding-32 four-text-white four-h5-btc-text">Bitcoin is NOT a physical currency which is why some pepole are so skeptical in
					it's value. This then makes the question, if I purchase a cup of Starbucks Coffee today at $3, is that 
					same cup considered $6 tomorrow? These are the real reasons why it needs to
					be regulated so price manipulation isn't a factor and can be used in increments
					or perhaps consider it like "Digital Gold" since no one in current day pays 
					anything in Gold.</h5>
